      <a><p>We looked at literature and how it should be reviewed in a proper manner for academic use. In addition i looked at how to properly reference using the APA 6 standard which is required at the university of portsmouth. An example of a reference that uses this standard is: Tucker, C. (2014). Social Networks, Personalized Advertising, and Privacy Controls. Journal of Marketing Research, 51(5), 546-562. doi: 10.1509/jmr.10.0355
        This week in the practical we looked at how we can properly write academically by using the proper language. We did this by looking at some alright standard text and adapting it to make it better by expanding the short sentences to make it clearer to the reader and also using a thesaurus to change out some of the words for ones that are more worthy.

  		<a><p>Today we created a webpage in html. The file is called example.html. Here is the code for it:<br>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
        <br>
        &lt;meta charset=UTF-8>
        <br>
        &lt;title>Hello CSS World&lt;/title>
        <br>
        &lt;article>
        <br>
        &lt;section>
        <br>
        &lt;h1 id=one class=special>First Steps&lt;/h1>
        <br>
        &lt;p id=two class=first>This is my Hello World paragraph.  Hurrah!&lt;/p>
        &lt;p id=three class=special>This is my second Hello World paragraph.&lt;/p>
        <br>
        &lt;/section>
        <br>
        &lt;/article>
        <p>Its pretty basic so far.
        By putting this:
        <br>
        #special_selection {
          background: yellow;
        }
        <p>Into the css document, you can refer to the name "special selection" in the HTML document to get the specific formatting.
          This can be done with:
        &lt;p id="special_selection"> Child's Tricycle2&gt;/p>
        <p>Where child's selection2 is background yellow. Any pre defining factors will remain the same unless changed here.

        By using a linux remote server we were able to host a simple website within the university network. This was accessible by either the wifi or a VPN.

      <p>Video can be used in the same way as a image. This means it can be warped and chopped and changed as seen in the example. This can be done through the css using the lines:<br>
        <br>
        #v2 {
          border-radius: 100%;<br>
          width: 100%; <br>
          animation: spin 400s infinite linear; <br>
        }<br>
      Where any image or video with the v2 tag can be warped using the animation named spin. The animation spin mus then be made. This was made in the example using the code:<br>

      @keyframes spin {<br>
          0% { transform: rotateZ(0deg) rotateY(0deg) rotateX(0deg) translateZ(-5vmin) scale(0.5); }<br>
          100% { transform: rotateZ(1800deg) rotateY(3240deg) rotateX(3960deg) translateZ(-5vmin)  scale(0.5); }<br>
        }<br>
    </a>

        <p> By using the Box model diagram in safari, I was able to work out why my navigation bar was leaving a gap in the top right corner. I was able to work out that my body tag in css was leaving a small marrgin by default. This was then set to 0 in the css so that the navigation bar fit the whole span of the page.

        <p>  Thoday i have learnt how to properly use aria tags in my website. To do this you create an element and fill it with text. Then in the image tag, add aria-describedby="" where in the quotes are the id of the element with the text.
